# Learn-AI

This is a repository where you and I learn about how AI works under the hood.

# Goals

The goals of this this repository are:

- To gain an understanding of how modern AI works
- To build a framework using no external libraries
- To implement core AI concepts from scratch (e.g., neural networks, backpropagation, gradient descent)
- To document and explain each component in a clear, beginner-friendly way
- To create a foundation that can be extended to more advanced models in the future
